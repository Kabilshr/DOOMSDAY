# DOOMSDAY
Over-complicated solution for a simple task just to learn.
I made this program to implement what i learned in python. There are easier ways to get the same result but that is not the point.
This program has 0 imports!
This is a program based on the doomsday algorithm made by John H. Conway. It is used to find out what day any date will fall on.

This is a file trying to figure out and understand the algorithm. There r many mistakes in it...
